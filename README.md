Discord just launched the new "Active Developer" badge and they're encouraging new developers to join the community and get it. If you're still learning and want the badge, follow the instructions below!

# Instructions ⭐
- Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, and create a new application on the account you want the badge on.
- Go to the bot tab and generate a bot for the application.
- Click the "Reset Token" button to generate a token.
- Copy the token to your clipboard.
- Click this badge to clone this repo to a new repl in Replit -> [![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/@mortyy/Active-Discord-Developer-Badge?v=1)](https://replit.com/@mortyy/Active-Discord-Developer-Badge?v=1)
  - You will be redirected to Replit, you might have to create an account (you can Register with Google or anything else).
- Once it has fully clonned go to the config.txt and paste in your discord bot token (the one you earlier created)
- Run The Code

- Go back to the application page, go to the "General Information" tab, scroll down and copy application id.
- Create a new discord server (you can delete it at the end).
- Enable community on the server (you only need to do this if you don't own any other discord server with community enabled)
- Return back to https://discord.com/developers/applications.
- Copy the application id.
- Use this invite link to add the application to the server: (replace ``{INSERT_CLIENT_ID}`` with what you copied) ``https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={INSERT_CLIENT_ID}&scope=bot&permissions=8``
- In the server, go to a channel and use the ``/ping`` command on the bot.
- Go to the <https://discord.com/developers/active-developer> page and register everything (**if it says you're not eligible, it's because you're not registered in their system yet. you might have to wait up to 24 hours**).
- Congrats on that shiny new badge.
